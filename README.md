# gravity-simulations
A gravity simulation that can compute numerically the trajectories of chaotic planetary orbits using simple Newtonian mechanics. 

- N Body Simulation: Displays the orbits of any n body system with a set of inputted initial conditions; built as practice for solving larger, more complex differential equations, as well as proof of concept of Newtonian gravitation and how far it can reasonably be pushed.
- 2 Body Simulation: Not sure why you would want to look at this, but it's just the N body simulation with more hard coding.  

Both run with Python 3.11+, with matplotlib, numpy, and scipy installed.
